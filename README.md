# Recipe-Finder

Program Description:
I developed a meal search application using JavaScript and the MealDB API. The application allows users to search for meals based on a category and displays the matching meal items. Users can click on a "Get Recipe" button to retrieve detailed recipe information for a selected meal. The application also includes a close button to remove the recipe details from the screen.

Tools Used:

JavaScript: The programming language used to build the application's functionality.
HTML/CSS: Used to structure and style the user interface.
Bootstrap: A popular CSS framework utilized for responsive and visually appealing design elements.
MealDB API: The application leverages this API to fetch meal data based on user search input.
